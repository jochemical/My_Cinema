# My Cinema

My Cinema is a webapplication in which users create their own personal movie list and add all kind of information including the year of production, last-watched date, director, cast, tags, series, description, star-grading and the embedding of a Youtube-iframe. The user should first register by creating a personal account using an e-mail adress and a new password. With this account the user can login and see his personal list of movies. Movies are added by using the add-button at the lower right corner. After clicking this button, a movie can be added by using an input form. Extra information can be added or adjusted later on using the edit-link. CSS-variables enable to choose between a light or a dark mode.
